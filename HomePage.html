      <h3 id="introduction">
        My name is Roei. I am a second-year student in Industrial Engineering
        and Management. Alongside my studies, I work in a networking company,
        which allows me to apply and develop my technical skills. I live in a
        kibbutz in central Israel, which gives me a unique perspective on both
        community life and professional growth. In my free time, I enjoy
        surfing, as it helps me relax and stay active. Iâ€™m always looking for
        new opportunities to learn and grow, both personally and professionally.
